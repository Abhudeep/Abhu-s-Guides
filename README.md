| **All about Pandas- assess and clean data** |[link](https://github.com/Abhudeep/Abhu-s-Guides/blob/main/All_about_pandas.ipynb)|Step by step guide for for data manipulation and analysis using Pandas. | 
| **All about Data Visualization** | [link](https://github.com/Abhudeep/Abhu-s-Guides/blob/main/Visualization.ipynb)| Step by step guide using **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: <br><br>**Distribution Plots**: <ul><li>**Displot**: The distplot shows the distribution of a univariate set of observations; </li><li>**Pairplot**: pairplot will plot pairwise relationships across an entire dataframe (for the numerical columns) and supports a color hue argument (for categorical columns); </li><li>**Rugplot** :they just draw a dash mark for every point on a univariate distribution. They are the building block of a KDE plot; </li><li>**KDEplot** : kdeplots are Kernel Density Estimation plots. These KDE plots replace every single observation with a Gaussian (Normal) distribution centered around that value </li></ul> **Categorical Data Plots**: <ul><li>**Factor plot**: factorplot is the most general form of a categorical plot. It can take in a kind parameter to adjust the plot type: Now called catplot;</li><li> **Boxplot & Violinplot**: boxplots and violinplots are used to shown the distribution of categorical data. A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) shows the distribution of quantitative data in a way that facilitates comparisons between variables or across levels of a categorical variable. The box shows the quartiles of the dataset while the whiskers extend to show the rest of the distribution, except for points that are determined to be “outliers” using a method that is a function of the inter-quartile range; dodge: **dodge** : When using hue nesting, setting this to True will separate the strips for different hue levels along the categorical axis. Otherwise, the points for each level will be plotted in one swarm.; </li><li>**Stripplot**: The stripplot will draw a scatterplot where one variable is categorical. A strip plot can be drawn on its own, but it is also a good complement to a box or violin plot in cases where you want to show all observations along with some representation of the underlying distribution:; </li><li>**Swarmplot**: The swarmplot is similar to stripplot(), but the points are adjusted (only along the categorical axis) so that they don’t overlap. This gives a better representation of the distribution of values, although it does not scale as well to large numbers of observations (both in terms of the ability to show all the points and in terms of the computation needed to arrange them); </li><li>**Barplot** : barplot is a general plot that allows you to aggregate the categorical data based off some function, by default the mean ; </li><li>**Countplot**: This is essentially the same as barplot except the estimator is explicitly counting the number of occurrences. Which is why we only pass the x value. </li></ul> **Matrix Plots**: Matrix plots allow you to plot data as color-encoded matrices and can also be used to indicate clusters within the data ; <ul><li>**Heatmap**: In order for a heatmap to work properly, your data should already be in a matrix form, the sns.heatmap function basically just colors it in for you;  </li><li>**Clustermap**:The clustermap uses hierarchal clustering to produce a clustered version of the heatmap </li></ul> **Grids** are general types of plots that allow you to map plot types to rows and columns of a grid, this helps you create similar plots separated by features; <ul><li> **PairGrid**: Pairgrid is a subplot grid for plotting pairwise relationships in a dataset.; </li><li>**Facet Grid**: FacetGrid is the general way to create grids of plots based off of a feature|
